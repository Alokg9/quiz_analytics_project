echo "## Project Overview"
echo "This project analyzes quiz performance data to provide personalized recommendations"
echo "for students preparing for exams. By leveraging historical quiz data, the system"
echo "identifies weak areas, improvement trends, and suggests specific study topics."
echo ""

echo "## Features"
echo "- Analyzes current and past quiz submissions"
echo "- Identifies weak areas and performance gaps"
echo "- Generates personalized study recommendations"
echo "- Predicts potential NEET exam ranks (bonus feature)"
echo "- Visualizes student performance trends"
echo ""

echo "## Dataset Information"
echo "1. Current Quiz Data – Contains details of a student's latest quiz submission."
echo "2. Historical Quiz Data – Includes the last 5 quiz performances for each student."

echo "## Approach"
echo "1. Data Analysis:"
echo "   - Load and clean quiz data."
echo "   - Identify student performance patterns by topic, difficulty, and accuracy."
echo "2. Insights Generation:"
echo "   - Detect weak areas and improvement trends."
echo "   - Classify student personas based on strengths and weaknesses."
echo "3. Recommendation System:"
echo "   - Suggest topics and question types for improvement."
echo "   - Optional: Predict NEET exam ranking using a probabilistic model."
